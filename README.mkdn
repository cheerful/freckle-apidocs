Freckle Restful API
===================

General
-------

The API for a freckle account can only be accessed via the accounts full URL.
So each API request has to be made to http://myfreckle.letsfreckle.com/api/<some-api-call>
where *myfreckle* is the account's subdomain.

An *authtoken* is needed for accessing the API. The token identifies the user and can be obtained from the users personal settings page.
It has to be sent for each request in either one of this two ways:

* as query parameter named `token`

  e.g `curl http://myfreckle.letsfreckle.com/api/projects.xml?token=10ee9d50a2f540518c5d1f9448e43f96056af626`

* as a custom HTTP header `X-FreckleToken`

  e.g `curl -H "X-FreckleToken:10ee9d50a2f540518c5d1f9448e43f96056af626" http://myfreckle.letsfreckle.com/api/projects.xml`

*Note*: To simplify authentication on mobile devices, the token can be received with the *api_auth_token* call, see the users section for more information.

----------------

Testaccount data:

*Note*: The data from this test account will be regularly wiped, so don't rely on it.

Data Formats
------------

In the examples XML will be used as data format. However, the API calls will mostly also accept and respond
to JSON.
