There are several 3rd-party open source libraries for popular languages
available:

* Ruby: [letsfreckle-client](https://github.com/ryanlecompte/letsfreckle-client)
* Python: [ipmb/freckle](https://github.com/ipmb/freckle)
* Node.js: [nodefreckle](https://github.com/tbranyen/nodefreckle)
* Clojure: [clj-freckle](https://github.com/mlehman/clj-freckle)

Additionally, the command-line tool [Pippi](https://github.com/sirkitree/pippi) can log time and access other API functionality, which is great if you want to use the Freckle API from a shell script.

<p class="note">
These are 3rd-party libraries and Freckle can't provide support for them.
Please contact the library authors directly if you need help with these.
